ECCO Version 4 release 4 (V4r4) constrains a global circulation model (MITgcm^) with diverse datasets that include satellite altimetry products like sea surface height (SSH); data derived from observations of earthâ€™s gravity field like ocean bottom pressure (OBP); observations from diverse in situ sources like Argo, CTD, XBT, ITP, APB, Glider, and TAO mooring temperature and salinity; and numerous other datasets. ECCO V4r4 is the first of the modelâ€™s multi-decadal ocean state estimates to cover the Arctic Ocean and provide truly global coverage. Itâ€™s also the first to assimilate observations from GRACE (ocean bottom pressure) and Aquarius (sea surface salinity), and the first covering 2016 and 2017.
